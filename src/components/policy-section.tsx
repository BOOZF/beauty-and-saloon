          Due to the time and product used that goes into your custom service,
          BB Beauty and Slimming does not offer refunds. We do offer adjustments

          other issues with treatments.

        <p className="text-neutral-700">
          Any errors need to be brought up to our attention within 72 hours of
          your appointment. Any adjustment request made after 72 hours will not
          be accommodated. Adjustments need to be scheduled no later than 7 days
          after notifying the salon and need to be scheduled with the original
          specialist.
